### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

iOS Developer with +5 years of experience. In my current job, I manage completely alone an app with +5.000 active users, from the initial discussion with Business Analysts until its release on Apple Store. Everything follows a well-defined Scrum process together with QA (Quality Assurance) team. 

My initial background came from Apple Developer Academy where I learned how to be proactive and self-unblocking. I love discussing and developing good solutions and working on something meaningful.
